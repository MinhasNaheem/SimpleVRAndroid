SimpleVRAndroid
===============

In this project we build a simple virtual reality (VR) app that allows the user to explore a virtual environment by moving the device. 
The app will use accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to determine the deviceâ€™s orientation.

A blog describing this project:

The project will run on Android devices with a gyroscope and an accelerometer. The devices should have ABI armeabi-v7a.
